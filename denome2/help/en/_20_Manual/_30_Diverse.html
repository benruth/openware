	<p><b>Error-Handling</b></p>
	<p>If problems occur you can try to resynch Denome 2 with the connected device by requesting the current State via the Menu-Entry: <i>Settings->Update</i></p>
	
	<p>Denome 2 reacts to Events that are transmitted by the Device. Sometimes those Events can contain obsolete informations which can result in unexpected changes of the user-interface.
	
	
	<br><br>
	<p><b>Maximal Volume</b></p>
	<p>The maximum volume depends on the user specified setting inside the Device and the current channel-settings.</p>
	<p>The scale of the volume-dial can change dynamically. Hence changes to specific channel-volumes can affect the display of the volume-dial.</p>
	

	
	<br><br>
	<p><b>Reset Settings</b></p>
	<p>Changes to the userinterface (position, size, ...) or the connected device-address are automatically saved. The Changes are saved in the following file:<br>
		<b>%APPDATA%\denome2\state.sav</b> <i>respectively</i> <br>
		<b>C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\denome2\state.sav</b> (default)
	</p>
	<p>The removal of this file will reset Denome 2 to <i>Factory-Settings</i>. The connection to the device will be lost; remember to save the Host-Address.</p>
